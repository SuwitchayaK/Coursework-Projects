The codes are from the assignment from the course ‘Introduction to Programming in Python.’  I wrote some Python functions to solve the assignment problems. The functions include for/while loops and ‘if’ statements.

I used R to create a 3x3 matrix and find to variance-covariance matrix. Later on, I computed the principal component analysis (PCA) for this matrix and extracted the first component. Finally, I calculated the proportion of variance explained by the first two PCs (PVE). The PVE is 94.86% which means that the first two components can capture most of the information in the given dataset.

K-means_anime_recommendation.ipynb

This project is from the course ‘Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with Applications.’ The course required an independent topic for the project that can use machine learning techniques. I chose this topic as I am a big fan of Japanese animation. The data is retrieved from the Anime Recommendation Database 2020 from Kaggle. It contains 12,406 animes and 310,059 users. Firstly, I did some visualizations including bar charts, pie charts, and heatmap. Lastly, I wrote a function that will return recommended animes based on K-means clustering. In addition, to determine the optimal number of clusters, I used both Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores.

This is the code from the Statistical Methods course. I used R for logistic and Poisson regressions.

PartIIB_Regressions.ipynb and PartIIB_NeuralNetworks.ipynb

This is the code for the project from the ‘Big Data for Computational Finance’ course. The objective is to predict whether the firm is investment grade given the data from 1700 firms. I used three methods including Linear and Logistic Regressions with Ridge and Lasso Regularizations, and Neural Networks. For feature selection, I used Random Forest and ANOVA F-test as they can work with the binary target variable. The R-square and MSE are used as the measurements for prediction accuracy. The results show that features selected based on ANOVA F-test perform slightly better than Random Forest and NN has the highest prediction accuracy.
