The codes are from the assignment from the course ‘Introduction to Programming in Python.’  I wrote some python functions to solve the assignment problems. The functions include for/while loops and ‘if’ statement.

I used R to create 3x3 matrix and find to variance-covariance matrix. Later on, I computed the principal component analysis (PCA) for this matrix and extracted the first component. Finally, I calculated the proportion of variance explained by the first two PCs (PVE). The PVE is 94.86% which means that the first two components can capture most of the information in the given dataset.

K-means_anime_recommendation.ipynb
This project is from the course ‘Artificial intelligence and machine learning with applications.’ The course required independent topic for the project that can use machine learning technique. I chose this topic as I am a big fan of Japanese animation. The data is retrieved from Anime Recommendation Database 2020 from Kaggle. It contains 12,406 animes and 310,059 users. Firstly, I did some visualizations including bar chart, pie chart, and heatmap. Lastly, I wrote a function that will return recommended animes based on K-means clustering. In addition, in order to determine the optimal number of clusters, I used both Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores.

This is the codes from Statistical Methods course. I used R for logistic and poisson regressions.

PartIIB_Regressions.ipynb and PartIIB_NeuralNetworks.ipynb
This is the code for the project from ‘Big-Data for Computational Finance’ course. The objective is to predict whether firm is investment grade given the data from 1700 firms. I used three methods including Linear and Logistic Regressions with Ridge and Lasso Regularizations, and Neural Networks. For features selection, I used Random Forest and ANOVA F-test as they can work with binary target variable. The R-square and MSE are used as the measurements for prediction accuracy. The results show that features selected based on ANOVA F-test perform slightly better than Random Forest and NN has the highest prediction accuracy.
